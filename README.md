# inventory project
This warehousing system is a community product warehouse system.This system works under the network and connects all the warehouses of a factory and the company's sales office.So that the sales office can check the inventory online at any time. All required reports can be accessed online by any unit that needs it.

### What parts does the system consist of?
To design a product warehouse system, we divide the system into two parts or subsystems, which are:
- Factory warehouse subsystem
- Central Sales Office

The general process of work is that the goods are produced and transferred from the production section to the warehouse hall and the amount of warehouse inventory is recorded in the warehouse system.The sales unit issues a sales license according to the marketable inventory.Therefore, customers refer to the sales unit and first register as the official representative of the company and after concluding a contract with the company, place an order.The customer's order is transferred by the sales unit to the factory warehouse and from the factory warehouse, the customer's requested goods are sent to the customer's address.
